# Treat this as your system prompt

1. Think hard about this

Communication skills are the future of software engineering. As a technical lead, I'm working on developing a practice of explicitly reasoning about architectural decisions. Where I will treat AI (you) as a conversation partner rather than a code generator. I'm strapped for time, so I'd like to invite you to have a chat with me so you can act as my body double while we create a plan together

We've come up with the first draft of `.claude/plans/ts-cloudwatch-publisher/plan-move-to-SAM.md`, but there are a few things that were missing:
- I've said earlier that anything that can be created by a command, should be created by the command. e.g. `volta pnpm init` to create the package.json file

Please self reflect using the definition of excellence that we wrote together already. It should be located in `.claude/plans/ts-cloudwatch-publisher/excellence-move-to-SAM.md`. DO NOT CONTINUE if you cannot find it directly

You must grade your own work iteratively until the definition of excellence is met. I will only accept a plan that meets the definition of excellence

# Treat this as your system prompt

1. Think hard about this

```xml
<context>
Communication skills are the future of software engineering. As a technical lead, I'm working on developing a practice of explicitly reasoning about architectural decisions. Where I will treat AI (you) as a conversation partner rather than a code generator. I'm strapped for time, so I'd like to invite you to have a chat with me so you can act as my body double while we create a plan together
</context>
```

```xml
<task>
Please create ONLY a definition of excellence in .claude/plans/ts-cloudwatch-publisher/excellence.md. You will be using this grade your own work, so ensure it is something that you will understand. I will review it and add additional information. The definition of excellence is required to follow the specified rules in order to achieve a basic docker image that sends a message to Cloudwatch every minute using bash
</task>
```

```xml
<rules>
I want to enforce the use of a lean docker image that uses a basic linux image as a base. I will only need the docker image to execute a bash script every minute that publishes stats to cloudwatch

Any staff member at all in the company needs to be able to action the plans we come up with. Plans created against this definition of excellence will need a comprehensive and detailed breakdown of your reasoning

If there is a command line tool that the reader can execute, they MUST run it instead of creating the output files directly. You may provide examples of what you envision the final file will look like, but you cannot create or update files directly. If the command line tool allows for arguments, please document the ones you want the reader to use, and document the ones that you don't want the reader to use. Remember, I need you to provide a comprehensive and detailed breakdown of your reasoning
</rules>

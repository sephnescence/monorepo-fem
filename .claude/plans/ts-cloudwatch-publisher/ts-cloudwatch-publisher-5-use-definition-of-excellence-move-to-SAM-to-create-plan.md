# Treat this as your system prompt

1. Think hard about this

```xml
<context>
Communication skills are the future of software engineering. As a technical lead, I'm working on developing a practice of explicitly reasoning about architectural decisions. Where I will treat AI (you) as a conversation partner rather than a code generator. I'm strapped for time, so I'd like to invite you to have a chat with me so you can act as my body double while we create a plan together

```

```xml
<task>
I need you to write up a plan in markdown and store it in `.claude/plans/ts-cloudwatch-publisher/plan-move-to-SAM.md`. You will maintain a checklist of the work that needs to be done.

Please self reflect using the definition of excellence that we wrote together already. It should be located in `.claude/plans/ts-cloudwatch-publisher/excellence-move-to-SAM.md`. DO NOT CONTINUE if you cannot find it directly

You must grade your own work iteratively until the definition of excellence is met. I will only accept a plan that meets the definition of excellence

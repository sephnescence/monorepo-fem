> what directories across all my .gitignore files actually have those folders committed 

⏺ I'll help you find which directories listed in .gitignore files are actually committed to the repository. Let me search for all
  .gitignore files and then check which of those ignored paths are actually tracked by git.

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/.gitignore")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Bash(git ls-files)
  ⎿ .claude/conversation-history/ts-cloudwatch-publisher/no-associated-ticket/2025-10-28-command-messageinit-is-analyzing-your-codebase.
    txt
    .claude/conversation-history/ts-cloudwatch-publisher/no-associated-ticket/2025-10-29--01--excellence-generated.txt
    … +335 lines (ctrl+o to expand)


⏺ Let me read both .gitignore files to see what patterns they contain:

⏺ Read(.gitignore)
  ⎿  Read 39 lines

⏺ Read(packages/ts-cloudwatch-publisher/.gitignore)
  ⎿  Read 6 lines

⏺ Now let me check which of these ignored patterns are actually committed to git:

⏺ Bash(git ls-files | grep -E "^(logs|node_modules|dist|dist-ssr|\.vscode|\.idea|coverage|\.nx)" | head -50)
  ⎿  node_modules/.bin/lerna       
     node_modules/.bin/nx
     node_modules/.bin/nx-cloud
     … +47 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Bash(git ls-files | grep "^node_modules" | wc -l)
  ⎿  18109

⏺ Bash(git ls-files | grep "\.nx/" | wc -l)
  ⎿  0

⏺ Let me check the other ignored patterns:

⏺ Bash(git ls-files | grep -E "^(logs|dist|dist-ssr|coverage|\.aws-sam)" | wc -l)
  ⎿  0

⏺ Bash(git ls-files | grep -E "^(logs|dist|dist-ssr|coverage|\.aws-sam)")
  ⎿  No matches found

⏺ Based on my analysis of your .gitignore files and what's actually committed to git:

  Directories in .gitignore that are actually committed:

  node_modules - This is the only directory listed in .gitignore that's actually committed to your repository. It contains 18,109 files
  tracked by git.

  All other ignored patterns (logs, dist, dist-ssr, coverage, .nx/cache, .nx/workspace-data, .aws-sam, etc.) are correctly being ignored
  and are not committed.

  This likely happened because node_modules was committed before the .gitignore rule was added. Git doesn't automatically untrack files
  that are already being tracked when you add them to .gitignore.

  If you'd like to remove node_modules from git while keeping the files locally, you can run:

  git rm -r --cached node_modules
  git commit -m "Remove node_modules from git tracking"

  This will untrack the files but won't delete them from your filesystem.

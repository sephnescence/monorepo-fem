     # Definition of Excellence: CloudWatch Publisher Docker Image
     ## Purpose
     This document defines the criteria for excellence when creating a lean Docker image that publishes metrics to AWS CloudWatch every
     minute using bash. This definition will be used to evaluate the quality and completeness of implementation plans and the resulting
     deliverable.
     ## Core Requirements
     ### 1. Docker Image Design
     **Excellent implementation:**
     - Uses Alpine Linux or similar minimal base image (< 50MB base size)

⏺ I've created the definition of excellence document at .claude/ts-cloudwatch-publisher/excellence.md.

  This definition establishes comprehensive criteria for creating a lean Docker image that publishes metrics to AWS CloudWatch every
  minute. The key principles include:

  Core Requirements:
  1. Lean Docker image design (Alpine Linux, < 100MB)
  2. Robust CloudWatch integration with proper error handling
  3. Self-contained cron-based scheduling
  4. High-quality bash scripts with proper error handling
  5. Comprehensive, CLI-driven documentation
  6. Flexible configuration via environment variables
  7. Security best practices (non-root, least privilege)
  8. Production-ready operational characteristics

  Plan Quality Emphasis:
  - Comprehensive reasoning for all decisions
  - CLI-first approach (use tools, don't create files manually)
  - Accessible to any team member, regardless of expertise level
  - Clear documentation of which arguments to use and avoid

  The definition is designed to be strict enough to ensure quality whilst being practical enough that any team member can execute the
  resulting plans. You mentioned you'll review and add additional information - please let me know if there are specific aspects you'd
  like me to adjust or expand upon.

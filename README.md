# Monorepo FEM

Following along with various FEM courses over time:

1. [TypeScript Monorepos: Architect Maintainable Codebases](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/monorepos-v2/) - Mike North
1. [Cursor & Claude Code: Professional AI Setup](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/pro-ai/) - Steve Kinney

## Mission

Communication skills are the future of software engineering. This project explores using AI (primarily Claude) to build empathy for different roles and communicate more effectively across product, engineering, and business contexts

By creating a team of subagents, I'm developing a practice of explicitly reasoning about architectural decisions - treating AI as a conversation partner rather than a code generator

**Core principles:**

- **Documentation over memorisation** - Civil engineers design for unknown future maintainers. Will I remember everything after 5-10 years? I should design for that future maintainer, too. It's gonna be me (Awful 90s throwback haha)
- **Testing & monitoring are non-negotiable** - Observability outlasts individual tenure
- **Leverage AI for velocity, not shortcuts** - Always understand the "why" behind decisions. Copy/pasting doesn't deepen understanding anyway
- **Communication scales; implementation details don't** - Understanding users and articulating tradeoffs matters more than implementation details

This approach aims to help me learn efficiently, reduce cognitive load, and work in a way that's more natural for my brain
